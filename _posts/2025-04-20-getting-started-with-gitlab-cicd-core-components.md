# 🚀 Getting Started with GitLab CI/CD: Core Components Explained

Hello everyone! 👋

In today’s DevOps-driven world, automating software delivery is essential.  
**GitLab CI/CD** provides an easy and powerful way to do this directly inside GitLab.

Let’s break it down step-by-step:

---

# 🛠️ 1️⃣ What is a Pipeline?

A **Pipeline** is a collection of **stages** that execute **jobs** automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.

Think of it as your automation engine! 🚀

---

# 📌 2️⃣ What are Stages?

A **Pipeline** is divided into multiple **stages** such as:

- `build`
- `test`
- `deploy`

Each **stage** contains **jobs** that run in sequence, ensuring an organized workflow.

---

# ⚙️ 3️⃣ What are Jobs?

A **Job** is a task performed inside a stage.  
Each job has:

- ✔️ A `script`: the set of commands to run
- ✔️ A `runner`: an agent that actually executes the job

✅ Jobs are the smallest executable unit in GitLab CI/CD.

---

# 💻 4️⃣ Script Execution Flow

Inside a job, the script execution follows:

- 🔹 `before_script` — Commands that run before every job (e.g., setting up dependencies)
- 🔹 `script` — The main commands for the job
- 🔹 `after_script` — Commands that run after the job (e.g., cleanup tasks)

---

# 📝 Example: Simple `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
```

✅ Each job is clearly linked to a stage.  
✅ Jobs in the same stage run **in parallel**.  
✅ Stages run **sequentially**.

# 🔥 Different Types of Pipelines in GitLab

| Type | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Basic Pipeline** | The classic pipeline with build, test, deploy stages |
| **Multi-Project Pipeline** | Triggers pipelines across multiple repositories |
| **Parent-Child Pipeline** | Splits big pipelines into smaller manageable pieces |
| **Merge Request Pipeline** | Special pipelines triggered during Merge Requests only |
| **Scheduled Pipelines** | Pipelines that run based on a cron schedule automatically |

# 🎯 Conclusion

GitLab CI/CD simplifies how teams build, test, and deploy software.  
Starting simple — by automating build and test stages — sets a strong DevOps foundation.

Stay tuned! In upcoming posts, I'll cover:

- Setting up your own GitLab Runner
- Docker image builds with GitLab
- Deployment automation to Kubernetes

Let's automate and innovate! 🚀
