# üß± Pods, ReplicaSets & Deployments ‚Äì Managing Kubernetes Workloads

In our previous posts, we explored [Kubernetes Components](https://viralsolani.github.io/devops/kubernetes/2025/04/27/what-is-kubernetes-and-components-overview.html) and how [Kubernetes Architecture](https://viralsolani.github.io/devops/kubernetes/2025/05/04/how-kubernetes-works-the-architecture-behind-the-scenes.html) functions behind the scenes.

Now it‚Äôs time to dive into **how applications actually run on Kubernetes** ‚Äî starting with:
- **Pods**
- **ReplicaSets**
- **Deployments**

---

## What is a Pod?

A **Pod** is the **smallest unit of deployment** in Kubernetes.
It represents:
- One or more **containers** that share storage/network
- Run as a single logical unit

### Multi-container Pods
Sometimes a Pod has **sidecar containers** ‚Äî for example:
- One container runs your app
- Another handles logging, proxying, or configuration

### Pod Lifecycle
- Pods are **ephemeral**: if a Pod dies, Kubernetes creates a new one
- For that reason, Pods are almost always managed by higher-level objects like ReplicaSets

---

## What is a ReplicaSet?

A **ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are running at any given time.

- It watches the state of your cluster and **automatically replaces failed Pods**
- Each ReplicaSet is tied to a specific template (i.e., Pod spec)

However, you typically won‚Äôt create ReplicaSets manually ‚Äî they‚Äôre usually managed by **Deployments**.

---

## What is a Deployment?

A **Deployment** provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.  
Think of it as a **blueprint** that defines:
- How many replicas (Pods) you want
- Which image to deploy
- How to perform updates or rollbacks

### Example YAML Snippet
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app-image:v1
```

‚úÖ This will ensure 3 Pods are always running using the `my-app-image:v1` image.

## Updates & Rollbacks
You can update the image version:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-app=my-app-image:v2
```
Roll back to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app
```

## Conclusion

Pods are the basic execution unit

ReplicaSets ensure Pods are always available

Deployments manage ReplicaSets declaratively and allow updates & rollback

These three resources form the core of how apps run in Kubernetes.

Next, we‚Äôll look at how to expose those apps using Services ‚Äî including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer types. ‚ò∏Ô∏è
