# 🚀 Getting Started with GitLab CI/CD: Core Components Explained

In today’s DevOps-driven world, automating software delivery is essential.  
**GitLab CI/CD** provides an easy and powerful way to do this directly inside GitLab.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

## 🛠️ What is a Pipeline?

A Pipeline is a collection of stages that execute jobs automatically.

## 📌 What are Stages?

Stages like `build`, `test`, and `deploy` organize your automation.

## ⚙️ What are Jobs?

Jobs are individual tasks (scripts) run inside stages.

## 💻 Example .gitlab-ci.yml

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building project..."

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..."
```

Happy CI/CD! 🚀
